##Intro
Living in a country like Poland you can go to the next supermarket and find a million of different foodstuff. But how to choose the right one, the healthiest meat, milk or orange juice?
Our project idea consists of two different applications: One is meant to be for patients (mobile app) and another one for doctors (web service). With the patient’s app, we are able to get from the user basic medical data, physical activities, allergies, environmental conditions (pollution, weather) and much more. Another source of very useful data is the users eating behavior. For this purpose, we developed a product scanner in the mobile app which allows the user to scan products (barcode) and receive basic data and an analysis of its ingredients (which are bad, which are good, what impact on people).
On the other side, we have developed an webservice for doctors who can monitor the patient’s data and recommend him for example to change his eating behavior and expand his physical activities.

## Build Setup for both aplications

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
